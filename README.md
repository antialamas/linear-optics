# linear-optics
A fast algorithm for simulating linear optical quantum circuits written in C++.

For more details and author contact information, refer to

https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01319

Compile with the included Makefile.

The linear algebra, Eigen, is required:

In main.cpp, we demonstrate how to use the LinearOpticalTransform object. We simulate the action of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer acting on a simple optical quantum state. Follow the comments for details.
