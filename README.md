# linear-optics
A fast algorithm for simulating linear optical quantum circuits written in C++.

For more details, refer to

(arXiv link)

Compile with the Makefile.

The linear algebra, Eigen, is required:

In main.cpp, we demonstrate how to use the LinearOpticalTransform object. We simulate the action of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer acting on a simple optical quantum state. Follow the comments for details.
